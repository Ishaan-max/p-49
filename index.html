        <h3>Camels are mammals with long legs, a big-lipped snout and a humped back. 
          There are two types of camels: dromedary camels, which have one hump, and Bactrian camels, which have two humps. Camels' humps consist of stored fat, which they can metabolize when food and water is scarce.11-Jul-2017</h3>

      <h3>Chameleons are distinguished by their zygodactylous feet; their swaying gait; and crests or horns on their brow and snout.
         Most species, the larger ones in particular, also have a prehensile tail. Chameleons' eyes are independently mobile, but in aiming at a prey item, they focus forward in coordination, affording the animal stereoscopic vision.
        Chameleons are adapted for climbing and visual hunting. T</h3>
